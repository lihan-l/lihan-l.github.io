                <b>Algorithm Description:</b><br>
                The bug navigation algorithm is composed of three different states
                (as shown in the left picture): <br>1. Stop the robot if it reaches the goal<br>
                    &emsp; There is a previous defined variable <i>error_threshold</i>, which is 
                    used for comparing with the <i> error (distance between the goal and robot current position)</i>. 
                    Once the error is within an acceptable range, it will stop. <br><br>
                2. Do wall following if it encounters obstacle<br>
                    &emsp;There is a previous defined variable <i> range_threshold</i>, which is used for 
                    comparing with the <i>ranges (the distance from the nearest obstacle)</i>. Once the
                    ranges variable is within the threshold, the robot will start wall following<br><br>
                3. Move toward the goal at a reasonable speed and in an appropriate direction<br>
                    &emsp;The last possible state is moving toward the goal. The algorithm calculates the
                    moving angle by taking inverse tanget of <i>error_y </i>/<i>error_x</i>, and then
                    scale the velocity in both x and y direction proportionally to make the total velocity
                    has a value of 0.6 m/s.

                <b>Some Problems:</b><br>
                1. The odemetry information provided by the encoder is not accurate enough<br>
                &emsp; This can be demonstrated by
                the video of showing the performance of <i>"hit the spot"</i>. Although the pose vector tells the robot 
                it is almost at the origin, but the distance from origin is actually bigger than the encoder thinks it is.
                This error could be accumulated, so the further the robot travels, the bigger the error is.<br>
                
                <br>
                2. The Algorithm might fail when there are multiple obstacles<br>
                &emsp;The robot is likely to get stucked when it encounter the enviroment
                where there are two close obstacles on its path to the goal.
                Since the robot will try to avoid both obstacles, it will stuck in the wall following state
                and sway between two obstacles. <br>

        <p>
            <b>Ways to Improve:</b><br>
            1. In order to reduce the position error between robot and the goal, we can improve 
            the accuracy of encoder, or utilize the camera to provide more information to tell the
            robot where it actually is.<br><br>
            2. In order to solve the issue which cause the robot sway between two obstacles, we can
            improve the wall following algorithm. Instead of start wall-following whenever it encounters
            the obstacle, we can write an algorithm that use an utility function to provide a path with 
            lowest cost while maintaining safety distance.
